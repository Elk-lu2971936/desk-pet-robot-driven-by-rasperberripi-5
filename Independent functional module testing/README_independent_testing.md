# 🧪 Independent Functional Module Testing

This folder contains the **early-stage prototype test code** used by our team to validate the hardware components purchased for the project.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

- Before full system integration, we independently tested various components (servo motors, OLED screens, microphone, etc.) to ensure proper **hardware functionality** and **GPIO signal handling**.
- These test files helped us confirm that the modules could respond to basic instructions before we moved on to full software development.

## ⚠️ Note

These files **do not represent** the final structure or logic of the main project.

👉 The actual feature-complete implementation is located in:

- `Speech_recognition_code_final_version/` → Handles **voice command processing**
- `Voice control servo/final_servo_control/` → Handles **servo motor + OLED display**
