A Raspberry Pi-based desktop pet robot with real-time motion control.
# Desktop Pet Robot
This project is a Raspberry Pi 5-based desktop pet robot that driven by voice or manual commands (e.g., sit, stand, move forward/backward) in real-time.
## Features
-  Voice or manual command control
-  Real-time response to commands (sit, stand, move forward/backward)
-  Smooth motion control using Raspberry Pi 5
-  ## Realtime Processing
The robot is designed to meet real-time requirements:
- **Low Latency**: Commands are processed within milliseconds to ensure immediate response.
- **Precision Control**: The Raspberry Pi 5's multi-core CPU and real-time operating system (RTOS) ensure smooth and accurate motion control.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Sensors and actuators are continuously monitored to adjust movements dynamically.
